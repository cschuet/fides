// Interface for accessing configuration values.
//
// SettingsDocuments contain settings as key-value pairs and allow querying
// values and enumerating settings keys. This header file defines an interface
// which offers a similar interface but provides a merged view on settings
// provided by a set of SettingsDocuments. SettingsDocuments can be partially
// ordered by the values of their respective vector clocks (see
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock). The view offered by this
// interface reflects the "latest" state of a setting given all inserted
// SettingsDocuments. When SettingsDocuments are inserted or removed the view is
// updated accordingly. SettingsDocuments with overlapping sets of settings keys
// which are concurrent (neither before nor later according to their vector
// clocks), are said to be "colliding". Attempting to insert a SettingsDocument
// which collides with an already inserted document is considered an error,
// insertion is aborted and the SettingsMap remains unmodified.
// SimpleSettingsMap is a map-based implementation of SettingsMap, which stores
// for each key a reference to the SettingsDocument providing the latest value.
// TODO(cschuet): Write a tree-based implementation of this interface that
//                offers better complexity for document removal.
